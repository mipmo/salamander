                    <p class="quote">I have no idea what this quote is gonna be, but i want it to feature the camels</p>
                    <cite>me, now, at home in front of my laptop</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    there seems to be a decent demand for actually creating a public ledger for betting camels.
                    though I am <em><strong>absolutely</strong></em> stoked that this idea has cought on, it
                    will take a little time,
                    as this is not a simple task if i want to actually do it correctly, especially considering i
                    <em>do</em> intend
                    to do other work for Uni/ETH like, ehm, <em>homework</em> and other reading & also am taking
                    extra
                    courses.
                    anyway,
                    I will be working on this on and off, so dont expect results blazingly soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the plan, for those who are interested is to split the page into 3 main sections:
                <ul>
                    <li>the first will be helpful stuff, like summaries, tips and potentially if i make TA even
                        my material
                        I might actually publish some minor work — assuming it's relevant on this part of the
                        page</li>
                    <li>next, the unhelpful stuff. stuff that i just wanna publish, but is of no real value to
                        other students:
                        <ul>
                            <li>joke papers, funny ideas that i wanted to write a paper about but not really
                                relevant</li>
                            <li>a blog for work i do or projects i am part of</li>
                            <li>strange and funny code snippets</li>
                        </ul>
                        you get the gist...
                    </li>
                    <li>finally, the camel bank: a online ledger to facilitate camel betting and keeping track
                        of debt/winnings</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    for now, however this page will be the main page you interact with on my website. <em>deal
                        with it.</em>
                    every now and so often, i might post a blog thingy — devlog? idk what — to appease those
                    with especially little patience. Also,
                    for my already inflated ego lol. jkjk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would say that there will be regular updates on this page, but tbh I have no idea.
                    I also hope you can find it in your heart to forgive my sloppy spelling and grammar on this
                    page, as i am writing it in a hurry and generally do not care so much about correctness at this moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have spent the last day or two just trying to figure out how to style the main
                    homepage
                    in particular, the issue is i have delusions of grandeur and want to make it look nice and
                    modern
                    this is less of a necessity as it is just my competitiveness wanting to outdo my fellow
                    student's homepages lol
                    the issue I have is that I am incompetent. well maybe i'm not, but it certainly feels like
                    it sometimes.
                    seriously, i do think i am a bit over ambitious at times. this is a pain.
                </p>
                <p>let me explain: the idea is to create three sections, right? (i'm just gonna go ahead and
                    assume u read the intro)
                    well the idea was to have a more or less clean home page with a nav bar on top, maybe a
                    footer for quick info and a background image that is split horizontally into 3
                    different sections, each with a different
                    effect on it that adopts that frosted glass look that is so popular nowadays.
                </p>
                <p>well, as you can imagine, there have been quite a few complications in this enire plan,
                    mainly because i do not have much webdev experience
                    (i am more of a c/c++ programmer), but also because the things i want to do are,
                    as far as i can tell, genuinely non-trivial.
                </p>
                <p>i was going to write more, but it seems if i dont eat lunch now, i will run late for my
                    lectures</p>
                sorry for the abrupt end, <br>
                ciao, 'till the next time!

                ok so i'm currently working on the main page... <br>
                here it is <a href="../ARCHIVE/placeholder.html">placeholder</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>basically, i forgot to write the post</h3>
            <p>
                yes, as it said in the title: i forgot to write this at the time i logged this update. In all
                fairness,
                I did a lot of work for the main page zou will first interact with on the finished website.
            </p>
            <p>
                so, to fill you all in on what i've been doing recently, i'll now finish this post. It's about
                20 past 1 in the afternoon and I'm
                in the train on the way to ETH right now, so i'll keep it brief, but in essence i've been bogged
                down with a lot of work
                for uni, as I have -for some stupid reason- taken some extra courses that increase my workload
                significantly over my fellow students.
                in particular, i have done some cool stuff in analysis III, where we are currently learning some
                very interesting material.
            </p>
            <p>
                as for my other projects, those have mostly been put aside. to my friend <b>hyde</b>: the
                mandelbrot thing is still planned lol,
                i just really dont have the time to design the circuitry. aditionally, the robot tea arm is just
                too difficult so i've entirely dropped that for now,
                and finally the shark is also somewhere on the list but tbh its just more work so again i'll
                leave it for another day.
            </p>
            <p>
                now, on to the website and more importantly, how far from release the camel bank is. I have
                finally made the most difficult part of the main
                page for the website in general, and am now working on a good looking interface for the bank. I
                suggest you look at the placeholder prototype
                page i have linked to demonstrate the stuff i've done.
            </p>
            <p>
                the backend will be worked on by the gracious hyde and will be ready at some point too.
            </p>
            <p>
                well the train will arrive in a few minutes, so i have to scarper
            </p>
            see you some time, <br>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                now, a few days ago - actually, 2 days ago - i made a neat little bet with my freind 
                (who will for privacy reasons remain nameless, but i'll call him bob here).
                you see, i've wanted to fold 10'000 paper cranes for a while (since i heard of the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_thousand_origami_cranes">japanese thingy</a> 
                that 1000 cranes bring luck or something, except i misremembered and thought it was 10'000). 
                so yea... i made a bet with bob that within the next 3 years i'd actually do it.
                I have yet to implement a crane counter and stuff but i <em>might</em>. i so far have officially 
                made 30, leaving me with 9'970 cranes left. 
            </p>
            <p>
                speaking of counters, i had this awful idea that the first thing you'd be greeted with on my website is a counter 
                saying: "It's been XXX seconds since i last had a cursed thought" or something, but maybe i'd make that like in the sidebar 
                or on the top, because i think it might just be a bit too obnoxious to have that as the load in screen for the whole website.
            </p>
            <p>
                adding to the general brain pain right now is the fact that i was working on an essay for pluralist philosophy of mathematics,
                which, while a cool subject, is sometimes quite taxing on the cranial matter. Granted, it's only a 500-750 word essay, so it's quite easy to 
                write, but i'm tired, and also philosophical texts are always harder to write.
            </p>
            <p>anyway, its late now (00:57, 2022/10/17) and I have lectures tomorrow; granted, they only start at 14:15 but nonetheless, i should better get some sleep.</p>
            good night and sleep well fellas!
