            <h2>In case you were wondering. Also, look at this cool ampersand: &</h2>

            <p>If you - for some unknown reason - find yourself on my nethz page, you might be wondering what this is all about.
                Truth is, I'm just using this page as free hosting for web design ideas and toys I might have. The current landing page index is, in fact, my "New Tab" page.
                This is all just for fun, and will probably cease to be maintained in about a week's worth of time when I inevitably lose interest in it.
            </p>
            <p>By the way, the following picture is the reason why this part of the website is so blue:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/clouds.jpg" alt="Blue sky with clouds">
                <figcaption>A very blue sky. Original by Alexandre Debieve on Unsplash.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The reason why that new tab page has a frosted glass/blur effect over the whole page is so it covers up the ridiculously low-res crop of a picture I took that I'm using as the background.</p>
            <p>Anyway, hope you're having fun. Have <a href="https://youtu.be/nn5q38-5ZLQ" target="_blank">Mariah Carey singing progressively slower</a> as a "reward".</p>
