            <p>By now, you will probably have noticed the very blue nature of this website. I would briefly like to explain this choice.
                It just so happens, that blue is my favourite colour. The shades used on this website are inspired by one particular image: A picture of clouds taken by Alexandre Debieve, <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/oBBqjbpdRWs" target="_blank">found on Unsplash</a>.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/clouds.jpg" alt="Blue sky with clouds">
                <figcaption>The blueified version of Alexandre's lovely picture.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The eagle-eyed among you may have realised that my picture is considerable more blue than the original by Alexandre. I took the liberty of adjusting the colours of the image to fit a very particular Ghibli-esque look that I had in mind.</p>
            <p>In future updates, I might use the image more prominently as a design element on this pointless website. We'll see about that. Toodle-oo!</p>

            <p>Inspired by <a href="https://n.ethz.ch/~vdamani" target="_blank">Vikram's sleek new website</a>, I decided to dust off what little is left of my web design skills and make a website for myself.
            To quote the Matt, however:</p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/1nd5HsxWXTI?t=26" target="_blank"><p class="quote">"I didn't come up with anything to say here."</p></a>
            <p>I could probably use this as a sort of blog. At the moment, that seems to be the most sensible option, though it remains to be seen if I actually follow through with the idea.</p>
            <p>As with pretty much all of my web design projects, this will probably end up abandoned in about one and a half weeks.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your visit, enjoy your stay, and don't forget to turn the lights off on your way out.</p>
